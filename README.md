# Echo

Echo is an AI reading companion that lets you open a PDF, read it, annotate it, and send content to an LLM without context switching.

## What it does

- **PDF reader** with search, bookmarks, page navigation, and zoom
- **Annotations** for highlights, comments, and free form notes
- **LLM integration** (OpenAI) so you can chat about the document without copy pasting content
- **Export** annotations and notes to Markdown, PDF or TXT

All data stays on your device. PDFs are loaded from your filesystem; annotations and settings are stored locally (and optionally synced to a file you choose). Your API key is stored encrypted in the browser and sent only to the provider you configure.

## Getting started

See [app/README.md](app/README.md) for prerequisites, installation, and usage.
